## Hosting a Code's Cool Dallas meetup

**_This is a ROUGH DRAFT and subject to refinement_**

This is an extension of the Nodeschool organizational guidelines to hosting an event, a portion of which is highlighted below.

From the [Nodeschool website](http://nodeschool.io/host.html):

> NodeSchool is a fully community driven effort and is 100% open source. This means that anyone can use the NodeSchool materials and/or host an event.
>
> The only expectations for event hosts is that events be not-for-profit (free or low cost) and that governance of events should have an open membership model (so that nobody can 'control' the events)

This document lays out the parameters for the Dallas chapter's organizing team to bring an event to your company/organization/backyard.  The materials are all open source and nothing prevents you from using them. You are always free to host an event on your own, without the Dallas team's help or access to our meetup group.

If you feel we have violated the spirit of Nodeschool's requirements or open source ethos please [create an issue](https://github.com/nodeschool/dallas/issues).

### Host requirements
In order to provide a great meetup environment that our membership is accustomed to hosts must agree to provide the following:

#### Undergraduate Level
- A room with
  - WiFi
  - Chairs
  - Air-conditioning / heating (ensure your building manager doesn't automatically turn it off in the evenings)
  - Projector
  - Power outlets (remember every attendee will have a lap top)
- Food approved by organizers
- Soft drinks & water
- Serving products (plates, cups, napkins)
- Company swag (ie stickers) to hand out to workshop finishers.
  - We use these as rewards for completing so make sure it's something people will want.  XXL t-shirts from last years company picnic aren't going to cut it.
  - We can help provide design ideas

#### Graduate Level
- All of the Undergrad requirements
- Beer or other premium drinks
  - Note that drunkenness is not tolerated.
- 2" hex sticker of your design or pay us to order generic ones with your name and colors
